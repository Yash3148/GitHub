             INFORMATION ABOUT GIT
-------------------------------------------------

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps developers manage and track changes to their codebase. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who developed the Linux kernel, and it has since become one of the most widely used version control systems in the software development industry.

With Git, developers can track changes to their codebase, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous versions of their code if needed. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, merging their changes together seamlessly.

Git stores the entire history of a project, including all changes made to files, in a repository. Each developer has their own local copy of the repository, which they can work on independently. They can make changes, commit them, and later push those changes to a central repository or share them with others.

One of the key features of Git is its ability to handle branching and merging efficiently. Developers can create branches to work on specific features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once they are satisfied with their changes, they can merge their branch back into the main codebase.

Git also provides tools for resolving conflicts that may arise when merging changes from different branches or when collaborating with other developers. It allows developers to review the history of a project, compare different versions, and annotate changes with comments.

Overall, Git is a powerful and flexible version control system that enables effective collaboration, code management, and version tracking for software development projects.
